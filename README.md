## Reanimation - 2024 
It's now 2024. Starting development back up after stepping away to do life things. 

I started Gogh as a way to have both a functional yet lightweight and modern UI for a photos app, with apps like IrfanView paving the way. Lots of changes to the Windows App landscape since then. UWP as a platform has been effectively dropped by Microsoft. WinUI/WinAppSDK is the successor and has been getting steady updates since I last worked on Gogh. The official Windows Photos app has recieved an overhaul as well, sunsetting the old one to a "Photos Legacy" app. Overall love the UI direction it has gone, mostly due to advances in WinUI, but the presence of ads for Microsoft services is disappointing. Gogh will get the updated WinUI look and hope to keep things more minimal. Goal is to still support Windows 10 users, despite it sunsetting Summer 2024.

Oh yeah 'aCropalypse' vulnerability happened a while back, wondering how that extends to Gogh as well since it relies on some similar core MS libaries.

Lastly, I never released an installable binary for yall, ops :/ Need to make one to publish to MS Store, so that will be on the priority list. You'll hear from me again soon!
